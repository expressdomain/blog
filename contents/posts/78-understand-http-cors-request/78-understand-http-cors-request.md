## What is CORS ü§î

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

## What is Preflight request in CORS? ü§®

Accoridng to <LinkPost name="MDN Docs" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request" />, A CORS preflight request is a CORS request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood and a server is aware using specific methods and headers.

It is an <LinkPost href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS
" name="OPTIONS" />¬†request, using three HTTP request headers: <LinkPost href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Request-Method" name="Access-Control-Request-Method" />, <LinkPost href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Request-Headers" name="Access-Control-Request-Headers" />¬†, and the <LinkPost href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin" name="Origin" />¬†header.

 Preflight request automatically issued by browser and frontend devs doesn‚Äôt do the options call.

OPTIONS call appears when request is qualified as "to be preflighted".

### How does the Preflight request works?

Before sending a POST request to server, you will ask the server for POST request.
<!-- <LinkPost href="" name="OPTIONS" /> -->
```jsx
OPTIONS /resource/foo
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: origin, x-requested-with
Origin: https://foo.bar.org
```

If the server allows it, then it will respond to the preflight request with an <LinkPost href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods" name="OPTIONS" /> response header, which lists¬†`POST`:

```jsx
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.bar.org
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

Lets take an example, you are working on a blog webiste <LinkPost href="http://blog.suprabha.me" name="blog.suprabha.me" /> and your API is on **api.blog.suprabha.me**. It‚Äôs really nice and easy to understand to see the prefix of blog webiste is ‚Äúapi‚Äù.

As you can see the the API(**api.blog.suprabha.me**) and the origin( <LinkPost href="http://blog.suprabha.me" name="blog.suprabha.me" />) are different, also the hostname is different. 

<br></br>
<p><mark>Port</mark> and <mark>Protocol</mark> also follow the same logic as hostname. So if there is any differences in hostname, port, protocol request executed on the page will require a CORS request.</p>

<br></br>
If you notice the header `sec-fetch-site` is attached to any XHR request in firefox/chrome browser which will indicate whether this was a same-origin request or not.

Quick example for cross origin request headers:

> Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site

<p><mark>cross-site</mark> tells the request initiator and the server hosting the resource have a different site.</p>

If you try to write proxy using node or use any services like Cloudfare to proxy your application, which create an alias to the api which routes **api.blog.suprabha.me** to **blog.suprabha.me/api** and moving over the JavaScript clients using the¬†`api.`¬†subdomain will cut your network traffic in half.
