<p><span class='first-letter'>U</span>sing CSS, links can be styled in many different ways.</p>

We can change the style of <mark>CSS link</mark> as:

1. <a href="#hover">:hover</a>
2. <a href="#active">:active</a>
3. <a href="#visited">:visited</a>
4. <a href="#focus">:focus</a>
5. <a href="#focus-within">:focus-within</a>
6. <a href="#focus-visible">:focus-visible</a>

<h1 id="hover">1. :hover</h1>

The `:hover` CSS pseudo-class triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor.

```css
a:hover {
    color: red
}
```

If you are using :link, :visited, :active. Remember to add hover after link and visited according to LVHA-order: **:link ‚Äî :visited ‚Äî :hover ‚Äî :active**.

<h1 id="active">2. :active</h1>

The `:active` CSS pseudo-class starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

```css
a:active {
    color: blue;
}
```

The `:active` pseudo-class is commonly used on `<a>` and `<button>` elements.

<h1 id="visited">3. :visited </h1>

The :visited CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited.

```css
a:visited {
    color: yellow;
}
```

<h1 id="focus">4. :focus </h1>

The :focus CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's Tab key.

```css
input:focus {
    background-color: green;
}
```

**NOTE** üìù Never remove the focus outline

<h1 id="focus-within">5. :focus-within</h1>

The :focus-within CSS pseudo-class represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by :focus.

```css
div:focus-within {
    background: cyan;
}
```

<h1 id="focus-visible">6. :focus-visible</h1>

The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class applies to provide a different focus indicator based on the user‚Äôs input modality (mouse vs. keyboard).

```css
.focus-visible:focus-visible {
    background: pink;
    color: red;
}
```

**Why do we need :focus-visible?**

`:focus` also do that same right? ü§î
But there is one problem. So imagine you wanted to remove outline of some button or links. Then it would be little bit problematic for those user who tries to access through keyboard. 

Here we can use **:focus-visible**, which applies when you actually want a visual indicator to help the user for focus to see.
