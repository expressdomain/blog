<p><span class='first-letter'>U</span>sing the native <mark>requestAnimationFrame</mark> method we can make our browser repeat something very quickly forever. It calls itself to paint the next frame.</p>

üìù <mark>Note</mark>: Your callback routine must itself call r**equestAnimationFrame()** again if you want to animate another frame at the next repaint. requestAnimationFrame() is 1 shot.

**requestAnimationFrame** takes one argument, only callback.

<b><u>Syntax:</u></b>

```js
window.requestAnimationFrame(callback);
```

**callback**: The function to call when it's time to update your animation for the next repaint.

Animations with **requestAnimationFrame** are non-blocking, which means if you make subsequent calls to **requestAnimationFrame**, the resulting animations will all occur at  same time.

The goal is **60 frame per second(fps)** to appear smooth animation.

So we do like this üëá

```js
setInterval(() => {
  // animation code
}, 1000/60);
```

But now we have **requestAnimationFrame**, which is more better and optimized:

- Animations will be so smooth as its optimized
- Animations in inactive tabs will stop, allowing the CPU to chill

Let's see how can we create the above snippet using requestAnimationFrame

```js
function smoothAnimation() {
	// animtion
	requestAnimationFrame(smoothAnimation)
}
requestAnimationFrame(smoothAnimation)
```

### How can you start and stop animation ‚è≤Ô∏è

**requestAnimationFrame** returns an ID you can use to cancel it.

```js
let reqAnimationId;
function smoothAnimation() {
	// animtion
	reqAnimationId = requestAnimationFrame(smoothAnimation)
}

// to start
function start() {
	reqAnimationId = requestAnimationFrame(smoothAnimation)
}

// to end
function end() {
	 cancelAnimationFrame(reqAnimationId)
}
console.log("reqAnimationId", reqAnimationId)
```

## Summary ‚àë

If you do any animation on browser and wanted it to be optimised, then would highly recoomend to use requestAnimationFrame web API.
